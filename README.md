# CentOS Slim
A custom slim docker image based on CentOS. Built from the base packages. This includes the base system and file system
support, but minimal tooling.

## Notable Differences
This image has a few differences from the base installation from CentOS. These may or may not appeal to you so be sure
to review the following before utilizing this image.

- The following additional packages are included:
  - `nano` - Text editor.
- The `/etc/resolv.conf` has been updated to point to Google's public DNS nameservers `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`.
- Docker-friendly changes were made to `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
- An `.ssh/` directory is created for the root account. However, the `openssh-clients` package is _**not**_ installed.
- The default working directory is `/srv/`.
- An empty `.started` file is created upon first startup of the container via the docker entrypoint.    
  If you start the container with a command other than the default, the entrypoint script is not run.

# Development
Before building, running, or publishing locally, create a `.env` file locally and define the following environmental variables:

```
BASE_VERSION=1.0.0
DOCKER_REPOSITORY=chriseaton/centos
CENTOS_VERSION=8
CENTOS_RELEASE_PACKAGE=centos-linux-release-8.3-1.2011.el8.noarch.rpm
CENTOS_REPO_PACKAGE=centos-linux-repos-8-2.el8.noarch.rpm
CENTOS_ROOT=image/rootfs
```
You can find repository packages on the http://mirror.centos.org/centos/$CENTOS_VERSION/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/ website (note the CENTOS_VERSION must be changed out).

## Building
Simply run the build script and the image will be created. 
```
sudo ./build.sh
```

## Publishing
To push to a registry, you can run the `publish.sh` script.
