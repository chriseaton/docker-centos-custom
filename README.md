# CentOS Slim
A custom slim docker image based on CentOS. Built from the base packages. This includes the base system and file system
support, but essentially no tooling. 

Currently as of the latest compiled release (CentOS v`8.3`), the image size is 257MB.

## Notable Differences
This image has a few differences from the base installation from CentOS. These may or may not appeal to you so be sure
to review the following before utilizing this image.

- Docker-friendly changes were made to `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
- The `nodocs` flag is set in the `dnf` configuration to reduce download sizes of packages within the container.
- An `.ssh/` directory is created for the root account. However, the `openssh-clients` package is _**not**_ installed.
- The default working directory is `/srv/`.
- An empty `.started` file is created upon first startup of the container via the docker entrypoint.    
  If you start the container with a command other than the default, the entrypoint script is not run.
- The `/etc/resolv.conf` has been updated to point to both CloudFlare and Google's public DNS nameservers: `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`, `8.8.8.8`, and `8.8.4.4`.
- The following environmental variables are set in the container:
  - `IMAGE_VERSION` The version of the docker image (not the OS).
  - `IMAGE_OS_VERSION` The long-form version of CentOS the image was built with.
  - `IMAGE_OS_DISTRO` This will always be "`CentOS`".

# Development
Before building, running, or publishing locally, create a `.env` file locally and define the following environmental variables:

```
BASE_VERSION=1.0.0
DOCKER_REPOSITORY=chriseaton/centos
CENTOS_BASE_VERSION=8
CENTOS_VERSION=8.3.2011
CENTOS_RELEASE_PACKAGE=centos-linux-release-8.3-1.2011.el8.noarch.rpm
CENTOS_REPO_PACKAGE=centos-linux-repos-8-2.el8.noarch.rpm
CENTOS_ROOT=image/rootfs
```
You can find repository packages on the http://mirror.centos.org/centos/ website. Packages are found under the
`BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/` path.

## Building
Simply run the build script and the image will be created. 
```
sudo ./build.sh
```

## Publishing
To push to a registry, you can run the `publish.sh` script.
